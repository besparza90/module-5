# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code
## https://besparza90.github.io/workday-scheduler/
The scheduler was built with the index file that used classes provided by the style sheet. Moment.js was used to retrive the current time and display it to the page.

The ready () was used to contain .on as an event listener to use the save button to store user input. This input is retrievd with APIs like .val and .getItem.
moment () is used to get the current time and compare it to the hour associated with each block. Depending on the relation, they will get colored by the added class from the style sheet.
